        <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
        
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.</p>

        <h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Supervised Learning</h4>
        <p>Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.</p>

        <h4>2. Unsupervised Learning</h4>
        <p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.</p>

        <h4>3. Reinforcement Learning</h4>
        <p>Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.</p>

        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> A set of rules or instructions given to an AI system to help it learn on its own.</li>
            <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> The dataset used to train the machine learning model.</li>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> The output of a machine learning algorithm run on data.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature:</strong> An individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed.</li>
            <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> When a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p>Machine learning has numerous applications across various industries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Image recognition and computer vision</li>
            <li>Natural language processing</li>
            <li>Recommendation systems</li>
            <li>Autonomous vehicles</li>
            <li>Medical diagnosis</li>
            <li>Financial fraud detection</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our daily lives. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of machine learning in the future.</p>
